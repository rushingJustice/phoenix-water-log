Radar indicated that rain in excess of 1 inch fell during this period, with additional rain occurring late into the day. The rain led to the flooding of washes in Scottsdale. According to a Fox 10 article, Scottsdale police identified the body of a woman found in a rain swollen wash in Scottsdale on Saturday afternoon on March 9th. The woman, 38 years old, was found in the wash just north of Chaparral Road, off Hayden Road. She lived in a group home about 1 imile away from the wash and she was reported missing Friday as the weather worsened. A man who was in the area Saturday afternoon spotted the woman floating in the water, and called 911. Police then arrived at the wash at about 430 pm Saturday.",

The cold front generated scattered thunderstorms, which produced locally damaging winds in the greater Phoenix area, and locally heavy thunderstorm rains caused some flooding of streets and washes. Flooding of washes occurred in the community of Scottsdale, and one woman was found dead in one of the flooded washes.",

Some of the hardest hit communities included Laveen, Ahwatukee and South Phoenix. At 1930MST, a trained weather spotter 3 miles northwest of South Mountain Park measured an afternoon storm total rainfall of 3.2 inches. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's office, heavy rain led to flash flooding and subsequently areal flooding. Numerous roads were flooded and closed, including the intersections of 27th Avenue and Cheyenne Drive, and 45th Avenue and Ivanhoe Street. Many homes in the area, especially those along Dobbins Road between 19th Avenue and 51st Avenue, suffered significant flood damage, as water 1-3 feet filled up their residences. The flooding also produced significant damage to the SRP water system according to SRP spokesman Jeff Lane. The flooding prompted the issuance of an Areal Flood Warning which remained in effect through the early morning hours on August 13th. No injuries were reported due to the flooding.",

Due to excessively moist atmospheric conditions, a Flash Flood Watch was in effect from noon August 12th through 5 am on Wednesday August 13th. Many of the thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain with rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour at times. The heavy rain led to urban flooding, flash flooding, and eventually areal flooding which affected much of the greater Phoenix area, especially the southeast and south central portions.",

Intense rain was observed with peak rain rates in excess of 4 inches per hour at times; this initially led to flash flooding which was followed by areal flooding. A mesonet rain gage 5 miles north of central Phoenix, near the intersection of Interstate 17 and West Camelback road, measured 2.91 inches of rain ending at about 1900MST. This led to flash flooding and water rescues at the Indian School underpass and Interstate 17. The heavy rains then resulted in continued areal flooding along the Interstate 17 corridor and an Areal Flood Warning was issued at 2015MST which remained in effect through 2315MST. Local law enforcement reported the continued flooding along Interstate 17 at Indian School Road and this was the basis for the Areal Flood Warning.",

Due to very moist and unstable conditions, the stronger thunderstorms that formed produced a variety of significant and severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail, very heavy rain, flooding and flash flooding. Public reports along with mesonet station readings indicated rainfall totals between three and four inches; the heavy rain led to road closures, flooding of underpasses and necessitated swift water rescues near the community of Cave Creek. Multiple Urban and Small Stream Advisories as well as Flood and Flash Flood Warnings were issued during the afternoon and evening hours. During the late afternoon, gusty thunderstorm outflow winds downed several power poles near Fountain Hills, and large hail was reported in central Phoenix.",

        "narrative": "The Maricopa County Flood Control District Gauge at Indian Bend Wash near Shea Boulevard reported water levels rising above alarm stage, which is 2 feet, at 3:30 am MST, peaking at around 2.31 feet (1055 cfs) at 6:00 am MST. Water levels dropped below alarm stage by 8:30 am MST. The intersection of North Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend Road was closed due to flooding from the elevated water levels from the wash. No damages or injuries were reported.",
        "episode_narrative": "An upper-level low pressure system moving across the Desert Southwest resulted in large scale forcing for ascent with highly anomalous moisture in place. This result in an area of moderate to locally heavy rain to develop over the Phoenix metro area with many areas receiving between 0.5-1. The rainfall was enough to cause Indian Bend Wash, located in Scottsdale, to reach action stage and thus cause some flooding along some low water crossings.",

        "narrative": "The Maricopa County Flood Control District Gauge located along Indian Bend Wash at McDonald Drive in Scottsdale measured water levels rising above the alarm stage level of 2.08 feet at around 7:50 PM MST on the 22nd and staying above that level through the next several hours before falling below alarm stage at around 6:50 AM MST on the 23rd. Therefore, several low-level water crossings intersecting the wash downstream  likely had flooding with the most significant impacts occurring along Roosevelt Street, where there was a video of a vehicle driving into the wash and stalling. No significant damages nor injuries were reported.",
        "episode_narrative": "Thunderstorm activity developed across much of eastern AZ, along the higher terrain features, during the early afternoon hours. Outflow boundaries emanating from the activity over the higher terrain areas sparked a complex of robust thunderstorms over Pinal County. A northwestward moving outflow boundary that developed from the Pinal County storms produced wind gusts in excess of 50 mph as well as areas of dense blowing dust across the Phoenix East Valley. Additional thunderstorm activity then developed over central Phoenix during the late afternoon, likely instigated by a convergence zone that set up right over the area with little convective inhibition in place and thus it did not take much of a triggering mechanism to get convective initiation. With MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/KG along with DCAPE of around 1500 J/KG, conditions were favorable for the generation of strong to severe downburst winds.",
