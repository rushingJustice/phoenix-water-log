An Urban and Small Stream Flood Advisory was issued at 120 pm for south central Arizona, including Fountain Hills and Scottdale, and it continued through 315 pm. Radar indicated that rain in excess of 1 inch fell during this period, with additional rain occurring late into the day. The rain led to the flooding of washes in Scottsdale. According to a Fox 10 article, Scottsdale police identified the body of a woman found in a rain swollen wash in Scottsdale on Saturday afternoon on March 9th. The woman, 38 years old, was found in the wash just north of Chaparral Road, off Hayden Road. She lived in a group home about 1 imile away from the wash and she was reported missing Friday as the weather worsened. A man who was in the area Saturday afternoon spotted the woman floating in the water, and called 911. Police then arrived at the wash at about 430 pm Saturday.",

Peak rainfall rates were well in excess of one inch per hour at times, and storm total rainfall amounts exceeded 3 inches. Some of the hardest hit communities included Laveen, Ahwatukee and South Phoenix. At 1930MST, a trained weather spotter 3 miles northwest of South Mountain Park measured an afternoon storm total rainfall of 3.2 inches. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's office, heavy rain led to flash flooding and subsequently areal flooding. Numerous roads were flooded and closed, including the intersections of 27th Avenue and Cheyenne Drive, and 45th Avenue and Ivanhoe Street. Many homes in the area, especially those along Dobbins Road between 19th Avenue and 51st Avenue, suffered significant flood damage, as water 1-3 feet filled up their residences. The flooding also produced significant damage to the SRP water system according to SRP spokesman Jeff Lane. The flooding prompted the issuance of an Areal Flood Warning which remained in effect through the early morning hours on August 13th. No injuries were reported due to the flooding.",

    "event_narrative": "Widespread showers and embedded thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall in Mesa during the morning hours on September 8th; peak rain rates were well in excess of 2 inches per hour and many locations received between 3 and 5 inches of rain with this event. The heavy rain led to significant urban flooding across Mesa, and one area that was especially hit hard was the Emerald Acres neighborhood located just north of US 60, and bounded by Stapley Drive and Harris. Water flowing towards the south ran up against a large berm protecting the Superstition freeway and had nowhere to go. A flood control canal bordering the freeway as well as several water retention basins were in place to protect against flooding; due to the excessive volume of runoff they were overwhelmed and as a result the neighborhood became flooded with one to three feet of water. Approximately 200 homes suffered significant flood damage and many residents had to be evacuated. Many of the homes suffered ruined flooring as well as damaged drywall that needed to be replaced. Crews started pumping water out of the area with large machines on Tuesday, September 9th and by early morning Wednesday, most of the water was removed from the streets in the Harris/Stapley neighborhood. It was estimated that water would not be completely removed for a week.",
    "episode_narrative": "Showers and embedded thunderstorms developed across south central Arizona during the early morning hours on September 8th, and as the morning progressed the showers intensified and became more and more widespread. Partially due to an infusion of tropical moisture from former hurricane Norbert, the storms produced intense rainfall with rainfall rates commonly in excess of 2 inches per hour and in some cases, in excess of 6 inches per hour for short periods of time. By the middle of the morning, most of the central deserts had received over two inches of rain, and many locations across the greater Phoenix metropolitan area picked up between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall. Phoenix Sky Harbor airport received 3.29 inches of rainfall with this event; the rain total set an all time record for any calendar date. The rainfall caused widespread flash flooding followed by flooding; numerous roads were closed. Several freeways were closed, including Interstate 10, as pumping stations failed and lakes several feet deep formed across portions of the freeways. Hundreds of cars were stranded across the greater Phoenix area, many buried to the top of their hoods in flood waters. Hundreds of homes and apartment complexes across the greater Phoenix area were flooded. Heavy rains damaged roofs across the valley, and collapsed the roof of a Fry's grocery store in Tempe. Clearly, the heavy rainfall led to a historic flooding event across south central Arizona on September 8th.",

    "event_narrative": "Releases at Granite Reef Dam were conducted in response to increased flow in the Salt/Verde River systems from the recent heavy rainfall. The Maricopa County Flood Control District stream gage along the Salt River below Granite Reef Dam showed flow peaking early in the afternoon on the 12th at 3,763 CFS. This resulted in increased flow down the Salt River, which impacted downstream unbridged crossings. Further downstream, a Maricopa County Flood Control District stream gage along the Salt River at Val Vista Drive showed flow from the upstream release peaking at 2,109 CFS. According to the Maricopa County Department of Transportation, McKellips Road was closed from SR 202 to Alma School Road due to the flooding caused by the releases. Timing was estimated using the stream gages and approximate downstream travel time to the areas impacted. No damage or injuries were reported.",
    "episode_narrative": "An upper level low sitting over central Arizona on the 11th and 12th led to the development of multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms across the region. Anomalously high moisture in the region allowed this activity to produce heavy rainfall which led to multiple instances of flash flooding across south-central and southwest Arizona. Some of these thunderstorms became strong to severe and produced strong wind gusts that led to several reports of damage. No injuries were reported.",

    "episode_narrative": "A moderate to strong atmospheric river aligned over South-central Arizona and led to widespread light to moderate rain across the region. Rain began falling the night of the 23rd and lasted through the evening of the 24th. The Phoenix area measured 1-2 inches and most foothill and mountainous areas measured 2-3 inches, with a few localized spots measuring 3-4 inches. The high rainfall amounts led to minor urban flooding and elevated flows in typically dry washes as well as in several major creeks and rivers. Elevated flows made at least one low water crossing in the Cave Creek area impassable. Flows coming down from Pinal Peak, within the 2021 Telegraph Fire burn area, also made some rural roads in the El Capitan area impassable. Tonto Creek in Tonto Basin experienced a 2-week long period with flow at or above action stage, beginning in the evening of the 24th.",

Given that the flows along rivers, small streams, creeks, and washes were elevated due to previous precipitation activity from previous storms and with the additional rainfall that fell, the water levels rose above alarm stage, resulting in flooding along low-water crossings.",

Outflow boundaries emanating from the activity over the higher terrain areas sparked a complex of robust thunderstorms over Pinal County. A northwestward moving outflow boundary that developed from the Pinal County storms produced wind gusts in excess of 50 mph as well as areas of dense blowing dust across the Phoenix East Valley. Additional thunderstorm activity then developed over central Phoenix during the late afternoon, likely instigated by a convergence zone that set up right over the area with little convective inhibition in place and thus it did not take much of a triggering mechanism to get convective initiation. With MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/KG along with DCAPE of around 1500 J/KG, conditions were favorable for the generation of strong to severe downburst winds.",
