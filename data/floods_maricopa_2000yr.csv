The heavy rain led to significant urban flooding across Mesa, and one area that was especially hit hard was the Emerald Acres neighborhood located just north of US 60, and bounded by Stapley Drive and Harris. Water flowing towards the south ran up against a large berm protecting the Superstition freeway and had nowhere to go. A flood control canal bordering the freeway as well as several water retention basins were in place to protect against flooding; due to the excessive volume of runoff they were overwhelmed and as a result the neighborhood became flooded with one to three feet of water. Approximately 200 homes suffered significant flood damage and many residents had to be evacuated. Many of the homes suffered ruined flooring as well as damaged drywall that needed to be replaced. Crews started pumping water out of the area with large machines on Tuesday, September 9th and by early morning Wednesday, most of the water was removed from the streets in the Harris/Stapley neighborhood. It was estimated that water would not be completely removed for a week.","Showers and embedded thunderstorms developed across south central Arizona during the early morning hours on September 8th, and as the morning progressed the showers intensified and became more and more widespread.

The unbridged Gilbert Road crossing sustained heavy damage due to the high flows in the river, keeping the road closed after waters had receded. End timing based on water releases from Granite Reef Dam.","Snowmelt runoff from the anomalous amounts of snow over the Arizona high terrain led to continued elevated flows in the Salt and Verde River watersheds. Dam releases being conducted in these watersheds to deal with the abnormal runoff led to continued downstream impacts along the Salt and Gila Rivers, which initially began in March. Continued releases from Granite Reef Dam allowed for elevated flows to persist in the normally dry Salt River with multiple unbridged river crossings remaining closed due to flooding. The heightened flows in the Salt River led to the fatalities of two men who were caught in an undercurrent while paddle boarding down the river. Releases from Granite Reef Dam were significantly reduced by the end of April as runoff into the watersheds decreased. Flow in the Salt and Gila Rivers continued to travel downstream to Painted Rock Dam. Releases from this dam led to elevated flows traveling down the Gila River into Yuma County, leading to numerous additional closures of unbridged river crossings. Elevated flows in the Salt and Gila Rivers allowed for impacts to persist into the month of May.",62

As a result of this, several downstream low water crossings between the dam and the Yuma County line remained impassable due to flooding. This led to the closures of Poco Dinero Road between Painted Rock Dam Road and Saddle Road as well as Rocky Point Road between Hyder Road and Painted Rock Dam Road continuing through the month of May. Any damage sustained to these roads due to the prolonged elevated flow in the Gila River is unknown.","Water being held in the Painted Rock Reservoir from abnormal winter and early spring runoff continued to be released downstream from April through the month of May. As a result of these continued releases from Painted Rock Dam, downstream impacts along the Gila River between the dam and the Colorado River persisted through the month. Impacts along the Gila River included continued road closures of multiple unbridged crossings. Flow in the Gila River began to drop below Action Stage by the end of the month as releases from Painted Rock Dam decreased. The long duration high flow that occurred in the Gila River resulted in multiple unbridged river crossings being damaged. According to local media reports, Yuma County Public Works reported that 14 unbridged crossings were damaged (1 paved road and 13 dirt roads) due to the flow in the river.",63

Approximately four hours later, the closure along the highway extended to Gila Bend. No damages or injuries were reported.","A shortwave trough moving across the Desert Southwest combined with well-above normal moisture, with precipitable water values peaking to around 0.8, resulted in multiple rounds of light to moderate rainfall with embedded thunderstorms across south-central AZ from the 21st to 23rd. Rainfall rates during these multiple rounds of rain generally ranged between 0.10-0.50, resulting in storm total amounts of between 0.5-3 across the region during a 72-hour period. The highest rainfall amounts were observed across portions of western Pinal and southwest Maricopa Counties, where there were reports of flooding.",64

Water levels dropped below alarm stage by 8:30 am MST. The intersection of North Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend Road was closed due to flooding from the elevated water levels from the wash. No damages or injuries were reported.","An upper-level low pressure system moving across the Desert Southwest resulted in large scale forcing for ascent with highly anomalous moisture in place. This result in an area of moderate to locally heavy rain to develop over the Phoenix metro area with many areas receiving between 0.5-1. The rainfall was enough to cause Indian Bend Wash, located in Scottsdale, to reach action stage and thus cause some flooding along some low water crossings.",65

Therefore, several low-level water crossings intersecting the wash downstream  likely had flooding with the most significant impacts occurring along Roosevelt Street, where there was a video of a vehicle driving into the wash and stalling. No significant damages nor injuries were reported.","Thunderstorm activity developed across much of eastern AZ, along the higher terrain features, during the early afternoon hours. Outflow boundaries emanating from the activity over the higher terrain areas sparked a complex of robust thunderstorms over Pinal County. A northwestward moving outflow boundary that developed from the Pinal County storms produced wind gusts in excess of 50 mph as well as areas of dense blowing dust across the Phoenix East Valley. Additional thunderstorm activity then developed over central Phoenix during the late afternoon, likely instigated by a convergence zone that set up right over the area with little convective inhibition in place and thus it did not take much of a triggering mechanism to get convective initiation. With MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/KG along with DCAPE of around 1500 J/KG, conditions were favorable for the generation of strong to severe downburst winds.",66
